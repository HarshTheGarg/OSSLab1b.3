The program contains various functions. This first function (initalizeMinHeap) is used to create a empty min heap which will later be used to store the tree.
swapMinHeapNodes swaps any 2 nodes in the min heap
The next few functions just return the parent/child nodes of the current node.
Functions to insert a element into the min heap is also available followed by the function to heapify the heap.
This program takes its intput graph from a file, hence there is a function available to convert the text data in this file to the actual weighted graph.
There are other helper functions also available to print the adjency matrix, print the menu etc.
Then there is a function to finally calculate the shortest path between the given nodes.
